## Introducing distance and similarity

{{< include ./_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd >}}

In **Week 2 Workshop** we had a go at merging datasets using fuzzy matching, from Chunk 43 onward.

We used the Levenshtein distance to calculate the distance between some strings, and set a maximum distance on which to match the column data in each of the two datasets we would like to merge.

Lets have a look at how the Levenshtein (lv) distance works.

We need the library `stringdist` which I have installed for you.

We can define our strings:

```{webr}
string1 <- "kitten"
string2 <- "sitting"
```

Calculate the Levenshtein distance

```{webr}
lv <- stringdist(string1, string2, method="lv")
```

Print the result

```{webr}
print(paste("Levenshtein distance between", string1, "and", string2, "is:", lv))
```

Try changing the strings!
