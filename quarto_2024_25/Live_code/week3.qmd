## Visualisations

{{< include ./_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd >}}

In **Week 3 Workshop** we are focusing on visualisations.

We can visualise for exploration or for communication. Here is an example using some of the extra features in `ggplot2` to produce a plot that is well annotated with a meaningful title, labels, a legend, and a clean theme.  It uses the built-in dataset `mtcars`.

Feel free to play around with the plot.  I have left an empty code chunk here for you to inspect aspects of the mtcars dataset (e.g. using `glimpse`, `head`, `str` etc) to help you.


```{webr}
# inspect the built-in mtcars dataset
```


```{webr}
# Create a scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) + #set the cyl column to a factor (category)
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +  # Add points with transparency and size
  labs(
    title = "Miles Per Gallon vs Horsepower",
    x = "Horsepower",
    y = "Miles per Gallon",
    color = "Cylinders"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +  # Use a clean theme
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.position = "top"
  )

```

Here is another way of looking at the data.

Have a think what each of the plots are telling you, and the relative advantages of different plotting types. You can try others types as well. The code will reset when you refresh the website.

Use the `ggplot` cheatsheet can help: https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-visualization-1.pdf

```{webr}
# Convert cyl to a factor to treat it as categorical
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y = mpg, fill = cyl)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = 0.6, 
    outlier.color = "red", 
    outlier.shape = 16, 
    outlier.size = 2
  ) +
  # Use a gentle color palette or customize your own
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightpink", "lightgreen", "lightblue")) +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of Miles Per Gallon by Number of Cylinders",
    subtitle = "Using the mtcars dataset",
    x = "Number of Cylinders",
    y = "Miles Per Gallon (mpg)"
  ) +
  # Remove the legend since the x-axis already implies cylinder groupings
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic", margin = margin(b = 10)),
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10))
  )

```
